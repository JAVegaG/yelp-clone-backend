# Yelp Clone Backend

This app is a Yelp clone created using Node.js based on the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://youtu.be/J01rYl9T3BU). This repository mainly addresses the backend, while the frontend can be seen [here](https://github.com/JAVegaG/yelp-clone-frontend).

This server-side part of the application communicates with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve information and serves it on an API for the clients to consume.
